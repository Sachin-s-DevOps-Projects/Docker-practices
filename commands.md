# Docker Commands

Some of the most commonly used docker commands are 

### 1) Lists docker images on the host machine
```
docker images
```

### 2) Builds image from Dockerfile
````

The -it flags tell Docker to make the container interactive and to attach the current shell to the containerâ€™s terminal

````
You can give a name to your Docker container by using the --name option with the docker run command

There are many arguments which you can pass to this command for example,

`docker run -d` -> Run container in background and print container ID
`docker run -p` -> Port mapping

use `docker run --help` to look into more arguments.
